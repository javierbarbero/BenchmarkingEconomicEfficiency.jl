BenchmarkingEconomicEfficiency.jl implements the Hölder function under the following norms: unit (h=1), infinitum (h=infty), and h=2, corresponding to the Euclidean distance. Computationally, the Hölder distance functions are related to non-linear optimization programs. However, for h=1 and h=infty it is possible to resort to linear DEA models because the topological balls associated with these norms define polyhedral sets. In these two cases the Hölder distance functions are equivalent to the directional distance function with a specific choice of directional vector. For h=1 it can be shown that TI_WHddotolder(G)left( textbfx_otextbfy_o1 right) is calculated as the minimum of the values TI_DDF(I)left( textbfx_otextbfy_o left(01_left( m right)0 right) textbf0_N right) m=1M, and the values TI_DDF(O)left( x_oy_o textbf0_M left( 01_left( n right)0 right) right) n=1N. These correspond to the input-oriented DDF model, which is solved M times, each with a unit valued element g^-_om=1 for every m input, and the rest of the m-1 elements equal to zero, plus the output-oriented DDF model, which is solved N times, again with a unit valued element, g^+_on=1 for  every n output and the rest of the elements equal to zero. In the case of h=infty,  TI_WHddotolder(G)left( x_oy_o infty right) is identical to the DDF model  with the directional vector fixed at left(mathbfg_x^-mathbfg^+_y right)= left( mathbf1_Mmathbf1_N right). The case of the Euclidean norm h=2 is complex because determining the shortest distance requires minimizing a convex function on the complement of a convex set. Pastor, Aparicio and Zofío (2022, Ch. 9) show that this distance can be calculated resorting to quadratic optimization. The first step to do that consists in writing the Euclidean distance from firm left( mathbfx_omathbfy_o right)  to the weakly efficient frontier as a bi-level linear program, which is a linear program that includes another linear program among its constraints:","category":"page"},{"location":"profit/profitholder/","page":"Profit Hölder model","title":"Profit Hölder model","text":"beginsplit\n TI_WHddotolder(G)left( mathbfx_omathbfy_o 2 right)= undersettextbfxtextbfypmblambdabeta pmbgamma mathopmin  sqrtsumlimits_m=1^Mleft( x_om-x_m right)^2+sumlimits_n=1^Nleft( y_n-y_on right)^2  \n\t st quad sumlimits_j=1^Jlambda _jx_jmle x_m quad  m=1M  \n\t  quad quad sumlimits_j=1^Jlambda _jy_jnge y_n quad  n=1N  \n\t quad quad  sumlimits_j=1^Jlambda _j=1   \n\t quad quad beta =0 \n\t quad quad undersetbetapmbgammamathopmax beta    \n\t quad quad stsumlimits_j=1^Jgamma _jx_jmle x_m-beta quad m=1M  \n\t quad quad sumlimits_j=1^Jgamma _jy_jnge y_n+betaquad  n=1N  \n\t quad quad sumlimits_j=1^Jgamma _j=1 \n\t quad quad lambda _jgamma _jge 0 quad j=1J  \n\t quad quad x_mge 0 quad m=1M  \n\t quad quad y_nge 0 quad n=1N  \nendsplit","category":"page"},{"location":"profit/profitholder/","page":"Profit Hölder model","title":"Profit Hölder model","text":"The literature presents different ways of solving Bi-level Programing models, from exact methods to heuristics and metaheuristics.

Contrary to the standard approach that relies on duality theory to obtain a suitable Fenchel-Mahler inequality from which allocative efficiency is recovered as a residual–see Revenue (In)Efficiency measurement, the GDA establishes an economic efficiency decomposition valid for any technical efficiency measure, EM(I), by considering the same single equality each time. For any firm left( textbfx_otextbfy_oright) and for an already selected EM(O) we just need to know two pieces of information, its technical inefficiency TI_EM (O)left( textbfx_otextbfy_o right) and its associated frontier projection left( hattextbfxhattextbfy_oEM(O) right). The GDA, providing a unifying framework for decomposing economic inefficiency, follows similar steps as the traditional approach but is easier to develop and implement since it does not rely on duality theory. It is general, because it can be applied to any efficiency measure; easier to implement, because it does not require to search for Fenchel-Mahler inequalities (although the underlying duality holds); and more reliable, because working with equalities instead of inequalities (and their associated normalization factors) avoids the possibility of overestimating allocative inefficiency as several traditional approaches do when failing to satisfy the essential property.","category":"page"},{"location":"revenue/revenuegda/","page":"Revenue General Direct Approach model","title":"Revenue General Direct Approach model","text":"The GDA approach breaks up revenue inefficiency of firm left( textbfx_o^textbfy_o^ right) into the sum of two components.

In turn, the duality of the MDDF with the profit function results in a normalization factor that is either cost or revenue, but not the sum of the two, which results in a meaningful interpretation of profit inefficiency as lost profit on outlay (cost) or lost profit on earnings (revenue). Second, while the DDF reduces inputs and increases outputs in the same proportion beta, the MDDF adds flexibility to the model by allowing for unequal variation in inputs and outputs when attaining technical efficiency. Therefore, the MDDF overcomes these two limitations of the standard DDF: 1) By presenting a dual relationship with the profit function, profit inefficiency has a sensible economic interpretation as either lost profit on outlay (dollar spent or cost) or lost profit on takings (dollar earned or revenue), and 2) it allows managers to adjust inputs and outputs asymmetrically when solving technical inefficiencies.","category":"page"},{"location":"profit/profitmddf/","page":"Profit Modified Directional Distance Function model","title":"Profit Modified Directional Distance Function model","text":"The MDDF function can be calculated through DEA methods by solving the following model:","category":"page"},{"location":"profit/profitmddf/","page":"Profit Modified Directional Distance Function model","title":"Profit Modified Directional Distance Function model","text":"beginsplit\n TI_MDDF(G)left( textbfx_otextbfy_otextbfg_textbfx^-textbfg_textbfy^+ right)=  undersetbeta _textbfxbeta _textbfypmblambda mathopmax  beta _textbfx+beta _textbfy    \n  st  quad sumlimits_j=1^Jlambda _jx_jmle x_om-beta _textbfxg_x_m^ quad  m=1M  \n  quad quad sumlimits_j=1^Jlambda _jy_jnge y_on+beta _textbfyg_y_n^ quad  n=1N  \n  quad quad sumlimits_j=1^Jlambda _j=1 \n  quad quad  lambda _jge 0 quad  j=1J  \n   quad quad beta _xbeta _yge 0    \nendsplit","category":"page"},{"location":"profit/profitmddf/","page":"Profit Modified Directional Distance Function model","title":"Profit Modified Directional Distance Function model","text":"where, as in the standard DDF, the vector mathbfg= left(mathbfg_x^-mathbfg^+_y right)neqmathbf0_M+N, mathbfg^-_xmathbbin R^M and mathbfg^+_ymathbbin R^N, which is specified by the researcher, sets the direction towards the production frontier.

For any firm left( textbfx_otextbfy_oright) and for an already selected EM(I) we just need to know two pieces of information, its technical inefficiency TI_EM (I)left( textbfx_otextbfy_o right) and its associated frontier projection left( hattextbfx_oEM(I)textbfy_o right). The GDA, providing a unifying framework for decomposing economic inefficiency, follows similar steps as the traditional approach but is easier to develop and implement since it does not rely on duality theory. It is general, because it can be applied to any efficiency measure; easier to implement, because it does not require to search for Fenchel-Mahler inequalities (although the underlying duality holds); and more reliable, because working with equalities instead of inequalities (and their associated normalization factors) avoids the possibility of overestimating allocative inefficiency as several traditional approaches do when failing to satisfy the essential property.","category":"page"},{"location":"cost/costgda/","page":"Cost General Direct Approach model","title":"Cost General Direct Approach model","text":"The GDA approach breaks up cost inefficiency of firm left( textbfx_o^textbfy_o^ right) into the sum of two components.
